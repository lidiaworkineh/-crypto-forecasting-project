# Crypto Market Data Analysis, Visualization, and Predictive Modeling

## Project Description

This project involves comprehensive analysis and forecasting of four major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Binance Coin (BNB). It covers data collection from public APIs, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series forecasting using ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM models, and the development of an interactive dashboard for visualization and model comparison.

The goal is to provide insights into cryptocurrency price dynamics and demonstrate effective predictive modeling techniques with an accessible user interface.
